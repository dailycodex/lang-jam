# FreeLang

### Why?
This programming language was made as an alternative to Lua for my game engine.

### Will I use it in the engine?
Probably not. It lacks many features that are needed.

### How to install
Download the .exe from the Build folder and in the cmd run: FreeLangInterpreter <filepath>
